 POL_donald_tusk_tt_delayed:0 "Donald Tusk's long career in politics began during the Polish People's Republic, involving himself in many anti-Communist and Liberal groups. Following the collapse of Communism in Europe, Tusk has been one of the largest figures in Polish politics, coming to the forefront as a Liberal power player after he co-founded the Civic Platform in 2001. His sweeping victories in 2007 and 2011 have given him tremendous backing to follow through with his socio-economic reforms in Poland, as well as trying to Poland's position in Europe as a new regional power in the east."

Can she hold the show together, or will the house of cards come crumbling down from under her?"
